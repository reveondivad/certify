The abolition of slavery with the 13th Amendment in 1865 was a pivotal moment in United States history. This event still impacts society today in various ways. The legacy of slavery has contributed to ongoing racial disparities and tensions. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, affirmative action policies, and the Black Lives Matter movement can all be seen as responses to the long-term effects of slavery.

However, I can provide a brief explanation.

Estimating the computational power needed to simulate a human brain is a complex and speculative task. The human brain is an incredibly intricate system with approximately 86 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections. The computational power required would depend on the level of detail at which the simulation is conducted. Some estimates suggest that it would take a machine with the computational capacity of at least an exaflop (10^18 floating-point operations per second) to simulate the human brain at the level of individual neurons and synapses. However, these are rough estimates, and the actual requirements could be higher or lower depending on various factors, including advances in our understanding of neuroscience and improvements in simulation techniques.","I'm sorry, but as an urban planner, I don't have the specific knowledge to estimate the computational power needed to simulate a human brain.
