Blue Prism Asd01,1,ProSafe credit reference agency retrieves data from bank and other credit providers where customers have missed payments or gone into default. The data is very sensitive and fed directly into a Blue Prism work queue via a web service. Blue Prism process must process the data within 4 hours. The Blue Prism solution runs continuously and each case takes approximately 30 seconds to process. It is expected that an average of 10 000 cases per day will be required and up to 10Blue Prism robots are available.The Blue Prism solution is sown below:For each case of the process will access the customer account in the HotRisk system and where an account exists harvest the data which will be fed along with the Work Queue data into a rules engine. The rules engine is a Blue Prism process that does not interact with any target system. It merely consumes data and via a complicated series of decision and choice stages determines the new customer risk factor.There is to be no scheduler used.

Blue Prism Asd01,3,"Pacific West Banking has a payments process that automatically receives pending payments from multiple regions into their payment system (Paytex).Paytex contains a queue of cases awaiting payment. When processing the case manually an agent must use two other systems the core banking system(DataPlus) and online account checker (FireWire).The manual processing must perform the following steps: Open the next case where the status is null in Paytex Set the status to ""In Progress"" in Paytex Validate source account in DataPlus Confirm source funds in DataPlus Check for fraud flags in Paytex Confirm recipient IBAN details in Firewire Perform payment in Paytex Update case in Paytex queue. Add payment confirmation number to case and set status to ""Completed"" Where cases cannot be fulfilled due to validation errors (e.g. invalid account details insufficient funds suspected fraud etc.) the customers will be contacted by the agent to resolve.A proposed Blue Prism solution with the following properties has been created to automate the payment processing: There will be one Blue Prism process that will perform the steps described above. Where a case is an exception the status will be set in Paytex to ""Manual Review"" in order that the manual team can pick up the case from Paytex and contact the customer and conclude the case. It is anticipated that to meet the SLAs of the expected volumes up to 5 instances of the Blue Prism process will be required to run concurrently. A Blue Prism work queue will be used to host the payments. The queue will be configured for only 1 attempt per case and the key will be (region) & {source account number}.The process will be started by the scheduler at 06:00 and will stop at 05:50.Which of the following are correct? (Choose three.) [] A. There is a risk that a payment can be duplicated. B. The process should not be designed to use a Blue Prism Work Queue but use Paytex as the work queue. C. The process will not scale i.e. you cannot run multiple instances at the same time. D. The solution exposes sensitive personal information. E. The process should not be automated as it uses a third party web application. F. There is a risk that a payment can be orphaned. ",BC
Blue Prism Asd01,4,"VivaBank have an account closure process that can take up to three days to close an account.

There are two scenarios:The timings relate to the expected automation time.All requests will arrive in a Blue Prism work queue from multiple channels using either web services or other Blue Prism processes.The following detail from the Functional Requirement Questionnaire must be considered: Cases must be processed on the same day if they come in between 08:00 and 22:00 Monday to Friday Exception cases are to be emailed to the manual team during processing as and when they occur. It is expected that up to 200 cases can be expected per day.The Blue Prism solution consists of four processes and four Blue Prism Work Queues.Cases come into the Account Closures Work Queue and are processed by the Account Closure process which determines if they are ""Nil Balance"" or ""Balance toTransfer"" scenarios. Before adding the case to the relevant work queue a check is made to see if an identical key has been added to the work queue today. If so the case is not added.The Transfer Balance process work its queue and for each successfully processed case adds case to the Close Account queue.The Close Account process works its queue and for each successfully processed case adds a case to the Confirm Closure queue with the case deferred to08:00 the next day.The Confirm Closure process completes the sequence by confirming that the account is finally closed.A scheduler has been created to start all four processes at 08:00. Each process shall be configured to finish accordingly:Please select from the statements below the ones you consider to be correct. (Choose two.) [] A. All processes should be merged into one process to optimize licenses. B.

English Test Preparation Toefl Reading Comprehension,1,"Most economists in the United States seem captivated by spell of the free market. Consequently nothing seems good or normal that does not accord with the requirements of the free market.A price that is determined by the seller or for that matter established by anyone other than the aggregate of consumers seems pernicious accordingly it requires a major act of will to think of price fixing (the determination of prices by the seller) as both ""normal"" and having a valuable economic function.

Hence a comparatively small number of large firms will be competing for the same group of consumers.

But each large firm will also act with full consideration of the needs that it has in common with the other large firms competing for the same customers. Each large firm will thus avoid significant price cutting because price cutting would be prejudicial to the common interest in a stable demand for products.

That's the only information I have! The only other thing I do is post photos and information about your work on the photo sharing site that I use with family and friends. I provide my email address and people send me their information if they want to see more of your work. Posting online really helps sales Carol. In fact the only complaint I hear is about having to come into the shop to make a purchase.`Carol replied `Jane that doesn't sound so bad. Could you just fix things and help us to post even more online?""` I can "" said Jane. `But it's not quite that simple.

At the end of the year Carol shared some exciting news. `Sam and Jane you have done such a great job that one of the biggest names in the glass business wants to buy us out!

Scrum Psm Ii,3,Paul is a Product Owner for multiple products. Each product is allocated a dedicated Scrum Team and a set budget. Based on the average velocity of a previous product release Paul had estimated a new product to take 9 Sprints to complete. The average velocity of the previous product release was 50 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints the Development Team reported an average velocity of 40 completed units per Sprint while not fully completing the required integration tests. The Development Team estimates that integration testing would require additional effort to make the increments shippable. TheDevelopment Team is unsure if the required velocity is achievable.What is the most effective way to recover? [] A. In the next Sprints the Development Team strives to make the selected work as close to 'done' as possible and at the minimum 90% completed. Any undone work is divided into new Product Backlog Items that will be deferred to the last Sprint in order to maintain stable velocity. B. The Development Team informs Paul that the progress he has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give Paul their estimate of the effort it would take to get the previous work 'done' and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The team also re-estimates the effort to make the remaining Product Backlog items 'done' including all integration effort. In the end it is Paul's call to continue the project or to cancel. C. The Scrum Master will manage the Sprint Backlog and assign work to the Development Team members to ensure maximum utilization of each member. He/ she will keep track of unused resources so that it does not impact the budget. Unused budget can be allocated for additional Sprints if needed. D. The Scrum Master sets the open work aside to be performed in one or more release Sprints. They remind Paul to find funding for enough Release Sprints in which this remaining work can be done. Up to one release Sprint per three development Sprints may be required. It is Paul's role to inform users and stakeholders of the impact on the release date. ,B

Soa S9008,4,A service agent has a technical contract that allows it to be explicitly invoked by service consumer programs. A. True B. False ,B
Soa S9009,1,Service A is an entity service with a functional context dedicated to invoice-related processing. Service B is a utility service that provides generic data access to a database.In this service composition architecture Service Consumer A sends a SOAP message containing an invoice XML document to Service A(1). Service A then sends the invoice XML document to Service B (2) which then writes the invoice document to a database.The data model used by Service Consumer A to represent the invoice document is based on XML Schema A. The service contract of Service A is designed to accept invoice documents based on XML Schema B. The service contract for Service B is designed to accept invoice documents based on XML Schema A. The database to which Service B needs to write the invoice record only accepts entire business documents in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.Due to the incompatibility of the XML schemas used by the services the sending of the invoice document from Service Consumer A through to Service B cannot be accomplished using the services as they currently exist. Assuming that the Contract Centralization pattern is being applied and that the Logic Centralization is not being applied what steps can be taken to enable the sending of the invoice document from Service Consumer A to the database without adding logic that will increase the runtime performance requirements of the service composition? A. Service Consumer A can be redesigned to use XML Schema B so that the SOAP message it sends is compliant with the service contract of Service A . The Data Model Transformation pattern can then be applied to transform the SOAP message sent by Service A so that it conforms to the XML Schema A used by Service B. The Standardized Service Contract principle must then be applied to Service B and Service Consumer A so that the invoice XML document is optimized to avoid unnecessary validation. B. The service composition can be redesigned so that Service Consumer A sends the invoice document directly to Service B. Because Service Consumer A and Service B use XML Schema A the need for transformation logic is avoided. This naturally applies the Service Loose Coupling principle because Service Consumer A is not required to send the invoice document in a format that is compliant with the database used by Service B. C. Service Consumer A can be redesigned to write the invoice document directly to the database. This reduces performance requirements by avoiding the involvement of Service A and Service B . It further supports the application of the Service Abstraction principle by ensuring that Service Consumer A hides the details of the data access logic required to write to the database. D. None of the above. ,B
Soa S9009,2,Service A is an entity service with a functional context dedicated to invoice-related processing.

Assuming that the Contract Centralization and Logic Centralization patterns are being applied what steps can be taken to enable the sending of the invoice document from Service Consumer A to the database without adding logic that will increase the runtime performance of the service composition? A. The Data Model Transformation pattern can be applied so that the invoice document sent by Service Consumer A is transformed into an invoice document that is compliant with the XML Schema B used by Service A . The Data Model Transformation pattern can be applied again to ensure that the invoice document sent by Service A is compliant with XML Schema A used by Service B. B. The service composition can be redesigned so that Service Consumer A sends the invoice document directly to Service B. Because Service Consumer A and Service B use XML Schema A the need for transformation logic is avoided. This naturally applies the Service Loose Coupling principle because Service Consumer A is not required to send the invoice document in a format that is compliant with the database used by Service B. C. The Standardized Service Contract principle can be applied to the service contract of Service A so that it is redesigned to use XML Schema A. This would make it capable of receiving the invoice document from Service Consumer A and sending the invoice document to Service B without the need to further apply the Data Model Transformation pattern. D. None of the above. ,C
Soa S9009,3,The Client and Vendor services are agnostic services that are both currently part of multiple service compositions. As a result these services are sometimes subjected to concurrent access by multiple service consumers.The Client service is an entity service that primarily provides data access logic to a client database but also provides some calculation logic associated with determining a client's credit rating. The Vendor service is also an entity service that provides some data access logic but can also generate various dynamic reports.After reviewing historical statistics about the runtime activity of the two services it was discovered that the majority of concurrent runtime access is related to the processing of business rules. With the Client service it is the calculation logic that is frequently required and with the Vendor service it is the dynamic reporting logic that needs to be accessed separately from the actual report generation.Currently due to the increasing amount of concurrent access by service consumers the runtime performance of both the Client and Vendor services has worsened and has therefore reduced their effectiveness as service composition members. What steps can be taken to solve this problem without introducing new services? A. The Rules Centralization pattern can be applied by extracting the business rule logic from the Client and Vendor services and placing it into a new Rules service. This will naturally improve the runtime performance of the Client and Vendor services because they will no longer be subjected to the high concurrent access of service consumers that require access to the business rules logic. B. The Redundant Implementation pattern can be applied to the Client and Vendor services thereby establishing duplicate implementations that can be accessed when a service reaches its runtime usage threshold. The Intermediate Routing pattern can be further applied to provide load balancing logic that can at runtime determine which of the redundant service implementations is the least busy for a given service consumer request. C. The Rules Centralization pattern can be applied together with the Redundant Implementation pattern to establish a scalable Rules service that is redundantly implemented and therefore capable of supporting high concurrent access from many service consumers. The Service Abstraction principle can be further applied to hide the implementation details of the Rules service. D. None of the above. ,B
Soa S9009,4,Currently due to the increasing amount of concurrent access by service consumers the runtime performance of both the Client and Vendor services has worsened and has therefore reduced their effectiveness as service composition members. Additionally a review of the logic of both services has revealed that some of the business rules used by the Client and Vendor services are actually the same. What steps can be taken to improve performance and reduce redundant business rule logic? A. The Rules Centralization pattern can be applied by extracting the business rule logic from the Client and Vendor services and placing it into a new Rules service thereby reducing the redundancy of business rules logic. The Redundant Implementation pattern can then be applied to establish a scalable Rules service that is capable of supporting concurrent access from many service consumers. B. The Redundant Implementation pattern can be applied to the Client and Vendor services thereby establishing duplicate service implementations that can be accessed when a service reaches its runtime usage threshold. The Intermediate Routing pattern can be further applied to provide load balancing logic that can at runtime determine which of the redundant service implementations is the least busy for a given service consumer request. C. The Rules Centralization pattern can be applied to isolate business rules logic into a central and reusable Rules service. Additionally the Service Abstraction principle can be applied to hide the implementation details of new the Rules service. D. None of the above. ,A

Test Prep Cfa Level 3,1,"Theresa Bair CFA a portfolio manager for Brinton Investment Company (BIC) has recently been promoted to lead portfolio manager for her firm's new small capitalization closed-end equity fund the Quaker Fund. BIC is an asset management firm headquartered in Holland with regional offices in several other European countries.After accepting the position Bair received a letter from the three principals of BIC. The letter congratulated Bair on her accomplishment and new position with the firm and also provided some guidance as to her new role and the firm's expectations. Among other things the letter stated the following:""Because our firm is based in Holland and you will have clients located in many European countries it is essential that you determine what laws and regulations are applicable to the management of this new fund. It is your responsibility to obtain this knowledge and comply with appropriate regulations. This is the first time we have offered a fund devoted solely to small capitalization securities so we will observe your progress carefully. You will likely need to arrange for our sister companies to quietly buy and sell Quaker Fund shares over the first month of operations. This will provide sufficient price support to allow the fund to trade closer to its net asset value than other small-cap closed-end funds. Because these funds generally trade at a discount to net asset value if our fund trades close to its net asset value the market may perceive it as more desirable than similar funds managed by our competitors.""Bair heeded the advice from her firm's principals and collected information on the laws and regulations of three countries: Norway Sweden and Denmark. So far all of the investors expressing interest in the Quaker Fund are from these areas. Based on her research Bair decides the following policies are appropriate for the fund:Note: Laws mentioned below are assumed for illustrative purposes."" For clients located in Norway the fund will institute transaction crossing since unlike in Holland the practice is not prohibited by securities laws or regulations.The process will involve internally matching buy and sell orders from Norwegian clients whenever possible. This will reduce brokerage fees and improve the fund's overall performance."" For clients located in Denmark account statements that include the value of the clients' holdings number of trades and average daily trading volume will be generated on a monthly basis as required by Denmark's securities regulators even though the laws in Holland only require such reports to be generated on a quarterly basis."" For clients located in Sweden the fund will not disclose differing levels of service that are available for investors based upon the size of their investment. This policy is consistent with the laws and regulations in Holland. Sweden's securities regulations do not cover this type of situation.Three months after the inception of the fund its market value has grown from $200 million to $300 million and Bair's performance has earned her a quarter-end bonus. Since it is now the end of the quarter Bair is participating in conference calls with companies in her fund. Bair calls into the conference number for SwiftPetroleum. The meeting doesn't start for another five minutes however and as Bair waits she hears the CEO and CFO of Swift discussing the huge earnings restatement that will be necessary for the financial statement from the previous quarter. The restatement will not be announced until the year's end six months from now. Bair does not remind the officers that she can hear their conversation. Once the call has ended Bair rushes to BIC's compliance officer to inform him of what she has learned during the conference call. Bair ignores the fact that two members of the firm's investment banking division are in the office while she is telling the compliance officer what happened on the conference call. The investment bankers then proceed to sell their personal holdings of Swift Petroleum stock.After her meeting Bair sells the Quaker Fund's holdings of Swift Petroleum stock.Do the suggestions in the letter from the principals of BIC violate any CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?

Answer the questions based upon what is stated or implied in the reading passage.For many years there has been much hand-wringing over the fate of Social Security once the baby boomers reach retirement age. Baby boomers people born between 1946 and 1964 represent the largest single sustained growth of population in the history of the United States. It is the sheer enormity of this generation that has had economists worried as retirement beckons. According to the U.S. Census Bureau by 2020 an estimated 80 000 000 Americans will have reached or surpassed the conventional age of retirement. With so many boomers retiring and drawing benefits but no longer paying into Social Security many fear that theSocial Security fund itself could go bankrupt.However a study released by the American Association for Retired Persons (AARP) that examined baby boomers' plans for retirement found that for the most part this generation is not expected to adhere to the conventional retirement scheme a fact that may please the worriers in Washington DC.In its survey the AARP broke baby boomers into different categories based on their financial standing degree of preparedness for retirement and optimism toward the future. The AARP found that of all groups surveyed only 13% planned to stop working altogether once they reached retirement age; the remaining87% planned to continue working for pay. The reasons to continue working varied among the different groups. For some the plan to continue working is a financial decision. Between 25% and 44% of respondents reported they are not financially prepared to retire and will therefore continue working past retirement age. For the remainder of those planning to work past their mid to late 60s the decision is based on long-held goals to start a business and/or the desire to stay active in their industry or community.Eventually most baby boomers will need to stop working as they progress into their 70s 80s and beyond. But with such large numbers planning to continue working thereby continuing to pay into the Social Security fund perhaps Social Security will be able to withstand the end of the baby boom and continue to be a safety net for future generations.Which of the following titles would be most appropriate for this passage?

Answer the question based upon what is stated or implied in the reading passage.In Ursula LeGuin's short story ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas "" everyone in the city of Omelas is happy everyone that is except the child who is kept locked in a basement closet. The child is left entirely alone and neglected except for occasional visits from the citizens of Omelas. They come at a certain age as a rite of initiation to learn the secret of the happiness they enjoy. They come to learn that their happiness has a price: the suffering of an innocent child. In the end most people stay in Omelas; but a few unable to bear the fact that they are responsible for the suffering of that child reject this utopia built upon a utilitarian morality.Utilitarianism is an ethical theory based upon the belief that happiness is the ultimate good and that people should use happiness as the measure for determining right and wrong. For utilitarian the right thing to do is that which will bring about the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. Furthermore utilitarianism argues that the intention of peoples actions does not matter; only the consequences of their actions are morally relevant because only the consequences determine how much happiness is produced.Although many useful social policies and much legislation are founded on this ""greatest good"" philosophy utilitarianism can be problematic as a basis for morality.First happiness is not so easy to quantify and any measurement is bound to be subjective. Second in a theory that treats everything except happiness as instrumentally rather than intrinsically valuable anything or more importantly anyone can (and should) be treated as a means to an end if it means greater happiness. This rejects the notion that human beings have their own intrinsic value. Further utilitarianism puts the burden of the happiness of the masses on the suffering of the few. Is the happiness of many worth the suffering of a few? Why do those few deserve to suffer? Isnt this burden of suffering morally irresponsible? This is the dilemma so brilliantly illustrated in LeGuins story.Utilitarianism could best be expressed in which of the following formulas?X _ action -Y _ consequences that create happinessZ _ consequences that create unhappiness A. Do X if Y _ Z. B. Do X if Y _ Z. C. Do X if Y _ Z. D. Do X if Y _ Z. E. Do X if Y _ Z. ",D

Answer the questions based upon what is stated or implied in the reading passage.For many years there has been much hand-wringing over the fate of Social Security once the baby boomers reach retirement age. Baby boomers people born between 1946 and 1964 represent the largest single sustained growth of population in the history of the United States. It is the sheer enormity of this generation that has had economists worried as retirement beckons. According to the U.S. Census Bureau by 2020 an estimated 80 000 000 Americans will have reached or surpassed the conventional age of retirement. With so many boomers retiring and drawing benefits but no longer paying into Social Security many fear that theSocial Security fund itself could go bankrupt.However a study released by the American Association for Retired Persons (AARP) that examined baby boomers plans for retirement found that for the most part this generation is not expected to adhere to the conventional retirement scheme a fact that may please the worriers in Washington DC.In its survey the AARP broke baby boomers into different categories based on their financial standing degree of preparedness for retirement and optimism toward the future. The AARP found that of all groups surveyed only 13% planned to stop working altogether once they reached retirement age; the remaining87% planned to continue working for pay. The reasons to continue working varied among the different groups. For some the plan to continue working is a financial decision. Between 25% and 44% of respondents reported they are not financially prepared to retire and will therefore continue working past retirement age. For the remainder of those planning to work past their mid to late 60s the decision is based on long-held goals to start a business and/or the desire to stay active in their industry or community.Eventually most baby boomers will need to stop working as they progress into their 70s 80s and beyond. But with such large numbers planning to continue working thereby continuing to pay into the Social Security fund perhaps Social Security will be able to withstand the end of the baby boom and continue to be a safety net for future generations.Which of the following titles would be most appropriate for this passage? A. The AARP and Social Security B. Baby Boomers Bankrupt Social Security C. Baby Boomers Will Work for PaybeyondRetirement D. Worries about Social Security May Be Unfounded E. Economists Fear Baby Boomers' Impact on Social Security ,D

Test Prep Lsat Section 2 Reading Comprehension,1,"Americans have always been interested in their Presidents' wives. Many First Ladies have been remembered because of the ways they have influenced their husbands. Other First Ladies have made the history books on their own.At least two First Ladies Bess Truman and Lady Bird Johnson made it their business to send signals during their husbands' speeches. When Lady Bird Johnson thought her husband was talking too long she wrote a note and sent it up to the platform. It read ""It's time to stop!"" And he did. Once Bess Truman didn't like what her husband was saying on television so she phoned him and said "" If you can't talk more politely than that in public you come right home.""Abigail Fillmore and Eliza Johnson actually taught their husbands Millard Fillmore and Andrew Johnson the thirteenth and seventeenth Presidents. A schoolteacher Abigail eventually married her pupil Millard. When Eliza Johnson married Andrew he could not read or write so she taught him herself.It was First Lady Helen Taft's idea to plant the famous cherry trees in Washington D. C.Each spring these blossoming trees attract thousands of visitors to the nation's capital. Mrs. Taft also influenced the male members of her family and the WhiteHouse staff in a strange way: she convinced them to shave off their beards! Shortly after President Wilson suffered a stroke Edith Wilson unofficially took over most of the duties of the Presidency until the end of her husband's term. Earlier during World War I Mrs. Wilson had had sheep brought onto the White House lawn to eat the grass. The sheep not only kept the lawn mowed but provided wool for an auction sponsored by the First Lady. Almost $100 000 was raised for theRed Cross.Dolly Madison saw to it that a magnificent painting of George Washington was not destroyed during the War of 1812. As the British marched toward Washington D. C. she remained behind to rescue the painting even after the guards had left. The painting is the only object from the original White House that was not burned.One of the most famous First Ladies was Eleanor Roosevelt the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was active in political and social causes throughout her husband's tenure in office. After his death she became famous for her humanitarian work in the United Nations. She made life better for thousands of needy people around the world.What is the main idea of this passage? A. The Humanitarian work of the First Ladies is critical in American government. B. Dolly Madison was the most influential president's wife. C. Eleanor Roosevelt transformed the First Lady image. D. The First Ladies are important in American culture. E. The First Ladies are key supporters of the Presidents. ",D
Test Prep Lsat Section 2 Reading Comprehension,2,"Of the many kinds of vegetables grown all over the world which remains the favorite of young and old alike? Why the potato of course. Perhaps you know them as ""taters "" ""spuds "" or ""Kennebees "" or as ""chips "" ""Idahoes "" or even ""shoestrings."" No matter a potato by any other name is still a potato- the world's most widely grown vegetable. As a matter of fact if you are an average potato eater you will put away at least a hundred pounds of them each year.That's only a tiny portion of the amount grown every year however. Worldwide the annual potato harvest is over six billion bags- each bag containing a hundred pounds of spuds some of them as large as four pounds each. Here in the United States farmers fill about four hundred million bags a year. That may seem like a lot of ""taters "" but it leaves us a distant third among world potato growers. Polish farmers dig up just over 800 million bags a year while the Russians lead the world with nearly 1.5 billion bags.The first potatoes were grown by the Incas of South America more than four hundred years ago. Their descendants in Ecuador and Chile continue to grow the vegetable as high as fourteen thousand feet up in the Andes Mountains. (That's higher than any other food will grow.) Early Spanish and English explorers shipped potatoes to Europe and they found their way to North America in the early 1600s. People eat potatoes in many ways-baked mashed and roasted to name just three. However in the United States most potatoes are devoured in the form of French fries. One fast-food chain alone sells more than $1 billion worth of fries each year. No wonder then that the company pays particular attention to the way its fries are prepared.Before any fry makes it to the people who eat at these popular restaurants it must pass many separate tests. Fail any one and the spud is rejected. To start with only russet Burbank potatoes are used. These Idaho potatoes have less water content than other kinds which can have as much as eighty percent water. Once cut into ""shoestrings"" shapes the potatoes are partly fried in a secret blend of oils sprayed with liquid sugar to brown them steam dried at high heat then flash frozen for shipment to individual restaurants. Before shipping though every shoestring is measured. Forty percent of a batch must be between two and three inches long. Another forty percent has to be over three inches. What about the twenty percent that are left in the batch? Well a few short fries in a bag are okay it seems. So now that you realize the enormous size and value of the potato crop you can understand why most people agree that this part of the food industry is no ""small potatoes.""What is the main idea of this passage? A. Potatoes from Ireland started the Potato Revolution. B. The average American eats 50 lbs of potatoes a year. C. French fries are made from potatoes. D. Potatoes are a key vegetable in America. E. The various terms for potatoes have a long history. ",D
Test Prep Lsat Section 2 Reading Comprehension,3,What does the word patent mean to you? Does it strike you as being something rather remote from your interests? If it does stop and think a moment about some of the commonplace things that you use every day objects that you take for granted as part of the world around you. The telephone radio television the automobile and the thousand and one other things (even the humble safety pin) that enrich our lives today once existed only as ideas in the minds of men. If it had not been possible to patent their ideas and thus protect them against copying by others these inventions might never have been fully developed to serve mankind. If there were no patent protection there would be little incentive to invent and innovate for once the details of an invention became known hordes of imitators who did not share the inventor's risks and expenses might well flood the market with their copies of his product and reap much of the benefit of his efforts. The technological progress that has made America great would wither rapidly under conditions such as these. The fundamental principles in the US. patent structure came from England. During the glorious reign of Queen Elizabeth I in England the expanding technology was furthered by the granting of exclusive manufacturing and selling privileges to citizens who had invented new processes or tools- a step that did much to encourage creativity. Later when critics argued that giving monopoly rights to one person infringed on the rights of others an important principle was added to the patent structure: The Lord ChiefJustice of England stated that society had everything to gain and nothing to lose by granting exclusive privileges to an inventor because a patent for an invention was granted for something new that society never had before. Another basic principle was brought into law because certain influential people in England had managed to obtain monopoly control over such age-old products as salt and had begun charging as much as the traffic would bear. The public outcry became so great that the government was forced to decree that monopoly rights could be awarded only to those who created or introduced something really unique. These principles are the mainstays of our modern patent system in the United States. In colonial times patent law was left up to the separate states. The inconsistency confusion and unfairness that resulted clearly indicated the need for a uniform patent law and the men who drew up the Constitution incorporated one. George Washington signed the first patent law on April 10 1790 and less than four months later the first patent was issued to a man named Samuel Hopkins for a chemical process an improved method of making potash for use in soapmaking. In 1936 the Patent Office was established as a separate bureau. From the staff of eight that it maintained during its first year of operation it has grown into an organization of over 2500 people handling more than 1600 patent applications and granting over 1000 every week.The Patent Office in Washington DC. is the world's largest library of scientific and technical data and this treasure trove of information is open for public inspection. In addition to more than 3 million U. S. patents it houses more than 7 million foreign patents and thousands of volumes of technical literature. AbrahamLincoln patented a device to lift steam vessels over river shoals Mark Twain developed a self-pasting scrapbook and millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt invented a shoe-shine kit. A patent may be granted for any new and useful process machine article of manufacture or composition of matter (a chemical compound or combinations of chemical compounds) or any distinct and new variety; of plant including certain mutants and hybrids. The patent system has also helped to boost the wages of the American worker to an unprecedented level; he can produce more and earn more with the computer adding machines drill press or lathe.Patented inventions also help keep prices down by increasing manufacturing efficiency and by stimulating the competition that is the foundation of our free enterprise system.The decades of history have disclosed little need for modification of the patent structure.Our patent laws like the Constitution from which they grew have stood the test of time well. They encouraged the creative processes brought untold benefits to society as a whole and enabled American technology to outstrip that of the rest of the civilized world.What is the main idea of this passage? A. The patent system encourages free enterprise. B. The Constitution protects the patent system. C. The patent system in England has been influential in American patent development. D. Patents are important tools for inventors. E. Patented inventions protect the inventor free enterprise and the creative process. ,E
Test Prep Lsat Section 2 Reading Comprehension,4,"Most people think its fine to be ""busy as a beaver."" Little do they know. Beavers may work hard but often they don't get much done. Beavers are supposed to be great tree cutters. It is true that a beaver can gnaw through a tree very quickly. (A six-inch birch takes about ten minutes.) But then what? Often the beaver does not make use of the tree. One expert says that beavers waste one out of every five trees they cut.For one thing they do not choose their trees wisely. One bunch of beavers cut down a cottonwood tree more than one hundred feet tall. Then they found that they could not move it. In thick woods a tree sometimes won't fall down. It gets stuck in the other trees. Of course doesn't think to cut down the trees that are in the way. So a good tree goes to waste.Some people think that beavers can make a tree fall the way they want it to. Not true. (In fact a beaver sometimes gets pinned under a falling tree.) When beavers cut a tree near a stream it usually falls into the water. But they do not plan it that way. The fact is that most trees lean toward the water to start with. Now what about dam building? Most beaver dams are wonders of engineering. The best ones are strongly built of trees stones and mud. They are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top.Beavers think nothing of building a dam more than two hundred feet long. One dam in Montana was more than two thousand feet long. The largest one ever seen was in New Hampshire. It stretched four thousand feet. It made a lake large enough to hold forty beaver homes.So beavers do build good dams. But they don't always build them in the right places. They just don't plan. They will build a dam across the widest part of the stream. They don't try to find a place where the stream is narrow. So a lot of their hard work is wasted.Beavers should learn that it's not enough to be busy. You have to know what you're doing too. For example there was one Oregon beaver that really was a worker. It decided to fix a leak in a man-made dam. After five days of work it gave up. The leak it was trying to block was the lock that boats go through. What is the main idea of this passage? A. Beaver's may be hard working animals but they don't always choose the most efficient mechanisms. B. Beavers are excellent dam builders. C. New Hampshire was the site of the largest beaver dam. D. Beavers are well developed tree cutters. E. Beavers are poor surveyors of aquatic environments in some cases. ",A
Test Prep Lsat Section 2 Reading Comprehension,5,The raisin business in America was born by accident. It happened in 1873 in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Many farmers raised grapes in this valley. That year just before the grape harvest there was a heat wave. It was one of the worst heat waves ever known. It was so hot the grapes dried on the vines. When they were picked California had its first raisin crop. People were surprised to find how good raisins were. Everybody wanted more. So the San Joaquin farmers went into the raisin business. Today of course they do not let the grapes dry on the vines. They treat them with much more care. In late August the grapes start to ripen. They are tested often for sweetness. The growers wait until the sugar content is twenty-one percent. Then they know the grapes are ripe enough to be picked. Skilled workers come to the vineyards. They pick the bunches of grapes by hand. The workers fill their flat pans with grapes. They gently empty the pans onto squares of paper. These squares lie between the long rows of vines. They sit in the sun. Here the grapes stay while the sun does its work. It may take two weeks or longer. The grapes are first dried on one side. When they have reached the right color they are turned to dry on the other side. The grapes are dried until only fifteen percent of the moisture is left. Then they have turned into raisins. The raisins are rolled up in the paper on which they have dried. Trucks take them from the fields. They are poured into big boxes called sweatboxes. Each box holds one hundred and sixty pounds of raisins. Here any raisins that are a bit too dry take moisture from those that have a bit too much. After a while they are all just moist enough.The big boxes are trucked next to the packaging plant. They are emptied onto a conveyor belt that shakes the raisins gently. This knocks them from their stems. A blast of air whisks the stems away. The water bath is next. Then the plump brown raisins have a last inspection. They are again checked for moisture and sugar.Then they go on a belt to packing machines. Here they are poured into packages which are automatically weighed and sealed. The raisins are now ready for market.What is the main idea of this passage? A. The creation of raisins in America was an accident. B. The process of raisin development requires multiple steps. C. Raisins on the grocery store shelf undergo a brief fermentation process. D. Raisins are cleaned thoroughly at the packing plant. E. California has been the leader in American raisin development. ,B
Test Prep Mcat Section 1 Verbal Reasoning,1,"In the early nineteenth century a large number of communal experiments both secular and religious sprang up in the northeastern United States. Perhaps the most famous secular commune was Brook Farm founded by transcendentalists George Ripley and William H.

Its members (among the more notable were Nathaniel Hawthorne and Margaret Fuller) pursued field labor by day art and philosophy by night. For a time the system worked so well that two afternoons a week were set aside for leisure and Brook Farm began outcompeting local farmers at the produce market. But by nature the Farms members were thinkers not workers; despite their success they remained mainly interested in the theoretical and philosophical implications of the experiment. Thus when a devastating fire brought the community considerable financial burdens in its fifth year the members felt little compunction about closing shop and returning to their comfortable Boston homes.One of the most notable religious utopias was the Oneida community.

The so-called `Third Stream` emerged at mid-century asserting itself against the opposition of a pair of mighty long-established currents psychoanalysis and behaviorism. The hostility between these two older schools as well as divisiveness within each of them probably helped enable humanistic psychology to survive its early years. But the movement flourished because of its wealth of insights into the nature of this most inexact science.Of the three major movements in the course of 20th century psychology psychoanalysis is the oldest and most introspective. Conceived by Sigmund Freud as a means of treating mental and emotional disorders psychoanalysis is based on the theory that people experience unresolved emotional conflicts in infancy and early childhood. Years later although these experiences have largely disappeared from conscious awareness they may continue to impair a person's ability to function in daily life. The patient experiences improvement when the psychoanalyst eventually unlocks these long-repressed memories of conflict and brings them to the patient's conscious awareness.In the heyday of behaviorism which occurred between the two world wars the psychoanalytic movement was heavily criticized for being too concerned with inner subjective experience. Behavioral psychologists dismissing ideas and feelings as unscientific tried to deal only with observable and quantifiable facts. They perceived the human being merely as an organism which generated responses to stimuli produced by its body and the environment around it. Patients' neuroses no longer needed analysis; they could instead by modified by behavioral conditioning. Not even babies were safe: B.F. Skinner devised a container in which infants could be raised under `ideal` conditions `"" if a sound-proof box can be considered the ideal environment for child-rearing.By mid-century a number of psychologists had grown dissatisfied with both the deterministic Freudian perspective and the mechanistic approach of behaviorism.They questioned the idea that human personality becomes permanently fixed in the first few years of life. They wondered if the purpose of psychology was really to reduce people to laboratory specimens. Was it not instead possible that human beings are greater than the sum of their parts? That psychology should speak to their search for fulfillment and meaning in life?It is questions like these that members of the Third Stream have sought to address. While the movement cannot be simplified down to a single theoretical position it does spring from certain fundamental propositions. Humanistic psychologists believe that conscious experience rather than outward behavior is the proper subject of psychology. We recognize that each human being is unique capable of change and personal growth. We see maturity as a process dependent on the establishment of a set of values and the development of self. And we believe that the more aspects of self which are satisfactorily developed the more positive the individual's self-image.Abraham Maslow a pioneer of the Third Stream articulated a hierarchy of basic human needs starting with food water and air progressing upward through shelter and security social acceptance and belonging to love esteem and self-expression. Progress toward the higher stages cannot occur until all of the more basic needs have been satisfied. Individuals atop the pyramid having developed their potential to the highest possible extent are said to be `self-actualized`.If this humanist theoretical perspective is aimed at empowering the individual so too are the movement's efforts in the practical realm of clinical psychology.Believing that traditional psychotherapists tend to lead patients toward predetermined resolutions of their problems Carl Rogers pressed for objective evaluations of both the process and outcome of psychotherapeutic treatment. Not content to function simply as a reformer Rogers also pioneered the development of `client- centered` or nondirective therapy which emphasizes the autonomy of the client (i.e. patient). In client-centered therapy clients choose the subjects for discussion and are encouraged to create their own solutions to their problems.If the author of this passage met a Freudian psychoanalyst who felt that it was important for patients to consider themselves capable of fundamental change he would most likely conclude that the psychoanalyst was: A. opposed to the Third Stream.

The Open Group Og0 092,1,Scenario: Rollins Manufacturing -Rollins Manufacturing is a major supplier in the automotive industry headquartered in Cleveland Ohio with manufacturing plants in Chicago Sao Paulo Stuttgart Yokohama and Seoul. Each of these plants has been operating its own Manufacturing Requirements Planning (MRPII) system production scheduling and custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.Rollins is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current MRPII and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases a third-party contractor could provide those staff.The Rollins Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.At a recent meeting the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the ChiefEngineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their MRPII and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect for the Common ERP Deployment architecture project.One of the earliest initiatives in the Enterprise Architecture program at Rollins was the definition of a set of IT principles and architecture principles that are well aligned with the overall enterprise principles. These now need to be updated to address the concerns raised.You have been asked to select a set of principles most appropriate for guiding the team to define a robust solution.[Note: You should assume that Rollins has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF 9 Section 23.6.]Based on TOGAF 9 which of the following is the best answer?   A. Common-use Applications Data is Shared Data is Accessible Data is Secure Interoperability Control Technical Diversity. B. Business Continuity Service-orientation Data is Accessible Data is Secure Responsive Change Management. C. Maximize Benefit to the Enterprise Business Continuity Common-use Applications Data is Shared Data is Accessible Data is Secure. D.

The Open Group Og0 092,2,Scenario: Global Mobile 1 -Global Mobile is a mobile telecommunications company formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions. They are yet to fully integrate the customer service systems for the most recent acquisitions and as result customer service has been a major concern for the Chief Technology Officer.Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average. The Corporate Marketing group has published some new findings about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to Air Light a competitor because of superior customer service. Global Mobile actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than Air Light and good roaming agreements that keep rates low for business travelers. But customer satisfaction has remained low.The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan. They have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board.The planning for the program has been underway for several months. Global Mobile has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture.The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation. The CorporateBoard has placed one additional major constraint on the program. In addition to achieving the business outcomes directly related to improving overall customer service within each business unit the Corporate Board expects the Target Architecture to produce an additional saving of at least 30% over current operating costs through energy efficiency initiatives virtualization of servers and workstations and expanded telecommuting and desk-sharing. This Green initiative is intended to become a model for future investments at all company facilities worldwide.You have been engaged as a consultant to advise the Chief Architect on the best ways to approach to the implementation planning activities for this significant business transformation.Based on TOGAF 9 which of the following is the best answer? (Is this the right answers to choose?) [] A. You recommend using conventional implementation planning techniques. The horizontal scope of the Green initiative would make the Capability-Based Planning approach used in the organization's TOGAF-based Enterprise Architecture framework difficult to manage and govern. This approach to planning was better applied within the vertical scope of a business unit. B. You recommend that the implementation planning activities be conducted using Capability-Based Planning. This is appropriate because the Green initiative is an enterprise-wide plan with a horizontal scope. Its metrics are aggregated at the enterprise level. It is crucial to gain business unit support and cooperation to achieve the broader business outcomes which will benefit all. C. The Capability-Based Planning approach used in the organization's TOGAF-based Enterprise Architecture framework is focused on business outcomes. The Green initiative is an infrastructure program that is technical in nature; therefore it would not be appropriate to use the Capability-Based Planning approach. Instead the Global Mobile systems development lifecycle approach should be utilized to develop the Solution Architecture. D. You recommend using conventional implementation planning techniques. The Capability-Based Planning approach is normally only used in public sector defense-related programs. This approach is not appropriate for a private sector company. ,B
The Open Group Og0 092,3,"Scenario: AGEX Inc.AGEX is a large global commodities trading company which has been growing rapidly through a series of acquisitions.Each new business is performing well in its markets. However the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to ""leverage the synergies"" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer products supplier and inventory information each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult costly and error-prone.As a result AGEX has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture.After reviewing the available alternatives and based on recommendations from the ERP vendor AGEX has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its EnterpriseArchitecture program.The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.You are serving as the Chief Architect.You have been asked to recommend the approach to take in the Preliminary Phase to ensure that the Corporate Board's concern is addressed.Based on TOGAF 9 which of the following is the best answer?   A. You evaluate the implications of the Board's concern in terms of regulatory and security policy requirements. You then update the AGEX security policy to reflect the concern ensuring that this policy is communicated across the organization. You allocate a security architecture team to ensure that security considerations are included in ongoing architecture planning. You then assess the security implications and agreements within the AGEX businesses and their suppliers. B. You evaluate the implications of the Board's concern in terms of regulatory requirements and their impact on business goals and objectives. Based on this understanding you then issue a Request for Architecture Work to commence an architecture development project to develop a solution that will address the Board's concern. You allocate a security architect to oversee the implementation of the solution in the ERP system that is being developed. C. You start by clarifying the intent that the Board has for raising this concern. This enables you to understand the implications of the concern in terms of regulatory requirements and the potential impact on current business goals and objectives. You propose that a security architect or security architecture team be allocated to develop comprehensive security architecture. D. You evaluate the implications of the Board's concern by examining the potential impacts on business goals and objectives. Based on your understanding you then update the current AGEX security policy to include an emphasis on the Board's concern. In addition you allocate a security architect to ensure that security considerations are included in the architecture planning for all domains. 19 ",A

A. You create an Architecture Contract to manage and govern the implementation and migration process. If the contract is issued to an external party you ensure that it is a fully enforceable legal contract. For internal development projects you decide it is adequate to utilize a memorandum of understanding between the Manufacturing Architecture Board and the implementation organization. You recommend that if a deviation from the contract is detected the Manufacturing Architecture Board should modify the Architecture Contract to allow the implementation organization the ability to customize the process to meet their local needs. As a result you then issue a new Request for Architecture Work to implement the modified Architecture Definition. B. You create an Architecture Contract to manage and govern the implementation and migration process. If the contract is issued to an external party you ensure that it is a fully enforceable legal contract. For internal envelopment projects you decide it is adequate to utilize a memorandum of understanding between the Manufacturing Architecture Board and the implementation organization. You recommend that if a deviation from the Architecture Contract is detected the Manufacturing Architecture Board grant a dispensation to allow the implementation organization the ability to customize the process to meet their local needs. C. You create an Architecture Contract to manage and govern the implementation and migration process.

Vmware 5v0 6219,1,Refer to the ACME Financials design use case.ACME Financials Design Use Case -1. Introduction1.1 Business OverviewACME Financials is an investment firm that has established itself as a leader in USA's fast-moving financial asset management market and has around 1000 employees.ACME plans to transform its end-user computing resources to the digital workspace. ACME wants a secure platform that is available from any device and from anywhere as well as a solution that reduces operating costs.ACME's major business driver for the digital workplace is to enable employees to work remotely and to enable the secure access to all of its resources from anywhere and any device while enhancing security with multi-factor authentication. The solution should support its BYOD strategy and let remote employees use their own laptop desktop or mobile device to access the resources from any location.ACME also wants to remove the need to supply and manage desktop hardware to external contractors. Because financial data is highly sensitive the firm needs a technology that would protect customer and other critical information - even when accessed on a mobile device. ACME is looking to improve the security of the desktop and application platforms across the enterprise. In addition to using endpoint security tools and multi-factor authentication ACME insists on using additional security and controls to provide the highest level of security and protection to services and applications.ACME currently uses a VPN-based remote access solution. ACME would like to remove additional components that add support or management complexity and device dependence for remote access users. ACME is looking to achieve the same access to virtual desktops and Windows 10 or mobile applications both inside and outside of the ACME enterprise network.ACME is very keen on enforcing standardization to keep the IT infrastructure as consistent as possible. IT wants to use standardized versions of Windows(Windows 10) consistent configurations and application delivery from a central source. All while maintaining the compliance of every device that requires encryption password and PIN protection as well as update -and anti-virus control.To simplify and standardize desktop and application delivery ACME wants to offer a service catalog based approach based on ACME IT standards. This will allowACME to effectively deliver and manage resources allowing IT to deliver device and application services that meet business and technical needs while maximizing the use of shared IT computing resources.Additional Facts - Speaking to the developers revealed that most apps are standardized apps from public app-stores but ACME uses some their in-house developed critical mobile apps where some of the developers have already left the company so that they cannot be rewritten in a short amount of time. To reduce operating costs ACME has already moved to Office 365 and is currently running a few migrations from on-premises to the cloud for other applications. ACME's IT says that it is a Microsoft Windows only shop but the assessment shows that currently most of the managers are using Apple devices. ACME currently uses directory services and two-factor authentication mechanisms (Radius) for internal and external access. ACME requires to support SingleSign-On (SSO) integration with their current authentication solutions. They also require to use SSO whenever possible as they do not believe in having multiple user accounts and passwords for their end users. ACME wants the solution to provide mechanisms to provide a secure e-mail solution to any device that complies to global security standards even for BYO devices.1.2 High Level User Classification 680 Office workers (call center corporate and office administrators) use standardized PCs or Thin-Clients to access ACME's core apps and tools. 240 Remote-office workers use the company's CYOD initiative and use these devices (Notebooks Convertibles Tablets Android phones) to access their apps and tools from remote. 30 Executives use Apple Mac Books as well as iPhones and iPads to work on- and off-premises. 80 IT -admins and software developers are using high-end workstations with administrative access.1.3 High Level Application Assessment ACME currently has 261 applications of which 186 are based on Microsoft Windows. Today users are allocated applications via AD group membership. 75 applications are either web-based or SaaS-based including Office 365. A major incident recently meant sales workers were disappearing suddenly along with their data and laptops on some new colonies. Any external access should require multi-factor authentication. Access from the internal network should work seamlessly with SSO for the core applications.High-security applications also require MFA from internal access. The address ranges of the HQ datacenter are as follows: 172.16.0.0/16 internal 80.34.57.20/21 external2. Initial Stakeholder Interview FindingsIn addition to the goals summarized in the previous section the following are findings from initial interviews with the key stakeholders and an analysis of their service level agreements.1. The design must use the F5 Loadbalancer and should be as redundant as possible.2. Qualified IT personal is hard to find these days. If possible reduce operational costs and try to automate or outsource basic IT-tasks.3. ACME is very particular about meeting the go-live date. If there are unforeseen delays the project may not be delivered for the required go-live date.Which key use case requires VMware Identity Manager? A. SSO authentication because they do not want to have to log-in multiple times B. SSO authentication to SaaS Apps with multiple logins for security C. SSO-based VPN with SSL-based authentication D. Active Directory NTLM authentication ,A
